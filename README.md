# Euler
These are my solutions to some of Project Euler's problems. They are all math-based problems that require skills in both math and programming to solve.
I only knew Java at the time, so all solution are in Java, and for some of them I gave myself some sort of challenge like fewest lines possible.

# Primes.txt
There is a file, primes.txt, which contains the first 300,000 primes, and it is used to solve some of the problems, but it is omitted from this repository.
